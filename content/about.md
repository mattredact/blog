SRE at █████████ building distributed systems with a focus on privacy and security. Linux/BSD and self-hosting enthusiast.

Outside of work I produce techno and jungle, and I'm slowly resurrecting a neglected 180sx in my garage.

Raised on BF2 Karkand, UT 2004, and vanilla WoW before they ruined it.
